# Rigid Body Simulation
A WPF application that simulates gravity between bodies

![Screenshot of the program with 8 moving bodies and 2 static bodies](docs/Particle_Simulation_G2ZmyDDore.png)

## Features
- Multiple ways of implemeting motion:
  - Euler method
  - Velocity Verlet
- Static and moving bodies
- Collision
- Trajectory

## How To Use
- The "Home" tab contains all the options
- The "On Click" section of the Home tab contains the options for what occurs when a click is registered.  Such as creating a static or moving body.


## Issues
- When there are many moving bodies, there will be performance issues.  This is simply becuase it is a rigid body simulation built in WPF
